# README.md generator ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
    
This project captures user answers to questions asked via the inquirer Node.js package. This data is passed into a template that will fill in the gaps with the captured user input. After the template is complete, the program writes the file to a dist directory where the file will be updated if it already exists in this folder.
